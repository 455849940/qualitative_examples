## qualitative examples of syntax and semantic differences of coding styles
![image](./Figure/IEexample.png)
Both copies of the code solve the same problem, but the code reflects different syntax and semantic styles.

### syntax style differences:
"{" in one copy of the code in the peer, the other code is not in the peer. It reflects the grammatical style difference in the format.

### semantic style differences:
1. One copy of the code uses tmp as a temporary variable name, and the other uses number as a numerical variable name, reflecting different semantic styles in naming meanings.
